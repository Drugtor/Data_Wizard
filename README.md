# Data_visualisation
My Visualisation Project for quick and dirty data science
It is based on CSV type data, as that is the most common format I work with. 
This is not meant for in depth analysis. Just a quick overview of raw data so you can get an idea of the results of your experiment.


### Work in Progress ###

Future Plans:

              > Clean up UI
              
              > Add Data Types
              
              > Bug fixes for edge cases
              
I might make this a selfcontained opensource App for private and academic use.
