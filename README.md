# Data_visualisation
My Visualisation Project for quick and dirty data science
This Version includes support for multiple Filetypes / CSV encodings.
This is not meant for in depth analysis. Just a quick overview of raw data so you can get an idea of the results of your experiment.


### Work in Progress ###

Road Map:

              > Clean up UI
              
              > Bug fixes for edge cases (such as tick overflow when using time date for x axis)
              
I might make this a selfcontained opensource App for private and academic use.
