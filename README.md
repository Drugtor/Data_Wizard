# Data_visualisation
My Visualisation Project for quick and dirty data science
It is based on CSV type data, as that is the most common format I work with. 
This is not meant for in depth analysis. Just a quick overview of raw data so you can get an idea of the results of your experiment.


### Work in Progress ###
Im still working on the sizing and format of this app.

I plan on making the axis of the plots adjustable as well as being able to export the plot as low res png.
